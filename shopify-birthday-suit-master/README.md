# Shopify Birthday Suit

Shopify Birthday Suit is an exceedingly bare bones Shopify theme intended for use by theme developers as a basis for their own theme development. It is not intended to be used "as is", rather as a building block. Feel free to modify and use for your own means.

The theme references a shop.js and style.css file but these are empty, consequently the theme is rendered with default browser styling. This is intentional.

## Install

To install the theme download the ZIP file and upload the same ZIP file to your Shopify store. Full details on uploading a theme can be found in the official Shopify docs: http://docs.shopify.com/themes/the-basics/build-your-theme/upload-theme.
